## About

**SwiftUI** is the future (and pretty awesome), but for those of us who still have to support iOS 12 (and 11, and sometimes even 10), it's going to take a couple of years before we can use it in production. **SwiftWidgets** is an attempt to simplify UIKit development using **reusable** and **composable** view containers (*widgets*). Widgets primarily live in in a table view (`WidgetTableViewController`), but you can easily embed them inside stack views, scroll views, other widgets, or just plain old `UIView`s.

## Installation


[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate SwiftWidgets into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'SwiftWidgets'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Quick Start

![Quickstart](Docs/quickstart.png?raw=true)

```swift
import SwiftWidgets

class QuickstartExample: WidgetTableViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        addWidget(ImageWidget.self) { // 1
            $0.image.image = üèô
            $0.height = 150
        }
        
        addReusableWidget(LabelWidget.self) { // 2
            $0.text.text = "Label widget with a pretty long text that will auto grow."
        }

        addReusableWidget(LabelWidget.self) { // 3
            $0.text.text = "Different font and text color."
            $0.text.font = Settings.Font.with(size: 45)
            $0.text.color = Settings.Color.darkGray
            $0.text.alignment = .center
            $0.tap = { widgetInstance in
                print("Text tapped - widget", widgetInstance)
            }
        }
        
        addWidget(ButtonWidget.self) { // 4
            $0.text.text = "Button"
            $0.text.font = Settings.Font.title
            $0.text.color = .white
            $0.padding.vertical = Settings.Offset.basic
            $0.cornerRadius = 1.0
            $0.buttonColor = Settings.Color.primary
            $0.height = 80
            $0.click = {
                print("button click")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

A short explanation:
1. Add a new image widget to the table view. Use the closure to set the image source to a `UIImage` and set the widget height to `150`.
2. Add a reusable label widget (widget views are reused via `tableView.dequeueReusableCell` and re-initialized using a new model instance).
3. Add a label widget, set the text content, font, color and aligment, and setup a tap handler callback.
4. Add a button widget with custom text, corner radius, vertical padding, and click callback. The button can be disabled, so it's preferable to use the `click` callback instead of the usual `tap` to prevent getting events in a disabled state.

In the following sections we'll talk about the widget anatomy and lifecycle, settings, making your own widgets and more.

### Widget Anatomy

Widgets are composed of a view (inherited from `Widget`) and a model (inherited from `WidgetModel`). To make your own widgets, just implement a pair of view - model and set `typealias Model` to the model class name. The `WidgetInstantiable` protocol will take care of the rest.

```swift
class CustomWidget: Widget, WidgetInstantiable {
    typealias Model = CustomWidgetModel
    
    @IBOutlet weak var mainLabel: UILabel!
    @IBOutlet weak var imageView: UIImageView!
    @IBOutlet weak var spacingConstraint: NSLayoutConstraint!
    
    public let imageComp = ImageComponent()
    
    override func load() {
        super.load()
        
        spacingConstraint.constant = CGFloat(model.titleImageSpacing)
        imageComp.setup(target: imageView, model: model.image, widgetModel: model)
        LabelComponent().setup(target: mainLabel, model: model.text, widgetModel: model)
    }
}

class CustomWidgetModel: WidgetModel {
    var image = ImageComponentModel()
    var text = LabelComponentModel()
    var titleImageSpacing: Float = 20
    
    // override defaults
    override func afterInit() {
        text.alignment = .center
        height = 300
    }
}
```

## Widget Layout

SwiftWidgets use the standard `margin - padding - content` layout model:

![Layout](Docs/layout.png?raw=true)

### Margin

Margin insets are set using `$0.margin.left`, `$0.margin.right`, `$0.margin.top` and `$0.margin.bottom`, as well as convenience properties `$0.margin.horizontal` for `left & right`, `$0.margin.vertical` for `top & bottom`, and `$0.margin.all` for all 4. The background color of the main view is set with `$0.color.background`.

### Padding

Padding insets are set similarly with `$0.padding.left` etc, and padding view background is set with `$0.color.padding`

### Content

The main content view is added with the `addContentView()` method or automatically selected as the first subview of the root view in a `xib` file. Its background color is set with `$0.color.content`.

### Separator

![Separator](Docs/separators.png?raw=true)

Widgets can have an optional separator (a horizontal line at the bottom) that is customized using `$0.separator.XXX`:

```swift
open class SeparatorModel {
    public var enabled: Bool // is separator shown or not?
    public var height: Float // height of the separator
    public var color: UIColor // separator color
    public var rightPadding: Float // right padding
    public var leftPadding: Float // left padding
}
```

### Accessory View

![Accessory](Docs/accessories.png?raw=true)

You can also set up an accessory view (`$0.accessory.type`) using predefined types (`.disclosureIndicator`, `.activityIndicator`, `.checkmark`) as well as by providing an image (`$0.accessory.image`) or a view (`$0.accesory.view`). Other customizable properties include `$0.accessory.size`, `$0.accessory.rightPadding`, and `$0.accessory.color`.

### Dimensions

By default, widgets have an intrinsic size defined by their inner constraints (such as `LabelWidget`s that grow with their content text). However, you can also explicitly define their height by setting `$0.height = 150`. This often happens when you want all widgets in a table to have a fixed size.

## Default Settings

On `init` the widget model is populated with default values. The default values are set up by calling
```swift
Settings.initDefaults(Config())
```
where `Config` implements the protocol `SettingsConfig`.

You can also get the default values directly, for example here we set the label up with a default title font, primary color and 2* the usual padding:

```swift
addReusableWidget(LabelWidget.self) {
    $0.text.text = "Use default settings"
    $0.text.font = Settings.Font.title // we could also use an explicit font size: Settings.Font.with(size: 25)
    $0.text.color = Settings.Color.primary
    $0.padding.all = Settings.Offset.basic2 // .basic = N, basic2 = 2*N, basic4 = 4*N etc.
}
```

For more default values please look up the `SettingsConfig` protocol, as well as `SettingsOffset` (`Settings.Offset.XXX`), `SettingsColor` (`Settings.Color.XXX`), and `SettingsFont` (`Settings.Font.XXX`).

You can use different configs to easily skin your widgets as long as you only use the `Settings` properties to set the widgets up.

## Widget Lifecycle

![Lifecycle](Docs/lifecycle.png?raw=true)

### Build

Widget views are either built in code (by overriding the `build()` method), or instantiated from a `xib` with the same name as the widget view. In the case of `CustomWidget` from **Widget Anatomy**, the widget is defined in `CustomWidget.xib` and `CustomWidget.swift`. If a `xib` hadn't been used, the widget view would have to implement the `build()` method instead:
```swift
public lazy var mainContent: UITextField = {
    let view = UITextField()
    return view
}()

public override func build() {
    addContentView(mainContent)
}
```

`build()` is called only once in the lifecycle, so use it to create all the necessary views, layout them using constraints and set the root view using `addContentView`. `addContentView` takes care of setting up the views and constraints needed to manage the basic layout (paddings, margins etc.)

### Load

After building the widget view, a model is added and the widget is set up using data from the model in `load()`. If you plan to reuse widgets in a table view (`addReusableWidget`), you'll need to handle `load()` being called multiple times during the lifecycle of the view with different models. This may necessitate some cleanup if your widget maintains state. If you don't plan to reuse your widgets, only a single `load()` with a single model occurs in the lifecycle of the view.

### Attaching to table cell

Widgets in a `WidgetTableViewController` are embedded in a table view cell (`WidgetTableViewCell`). You can make changes to the cell in `attachedToCell()`: 
```swift
override func attachedToCell() {
    parentCell?.isUserInteractionEnabled = true
}
```

### Reusing

When reusing the view, a new model is added, and `load()` and `attachedToCell()` are called again. After that the view is ready to be used again.

## Widget Containers

There are several built-in containers that display and layout widgets (listed below). If you require something more specific, you can easily write your own by implementing the `WidgetContainer` protocol. The protocol defines common methods such as `addWidget`, so little effort is required when displaying widgets in a different container (mostly setting up the container).

### WidgetTableViewController

`WidgetTableViewController` is the default container used to to display widgets. It automatically displays the widgets in a table view and takes care of scrolling, reusing widgets etc.

![WidgetTableViewController](Docs/widgettablevc.png?raw=true)

### VerticalWidgetViewContainer

`VerticalWidgetViewContainer` renders widgets in a plain `UIView` from top to bottom with no scrolling and widget reusing. A typical use case is anchoring the container to the bottom of the window and showing a widget or two over the rest of the screen content.

### Vertical Container Widget

`VContainerWidget` renders widgets inside of a widget vertically. It's more or less just a `VerticalWidgetViewContainer` encapsulated inside a widget.

### Horizontal Scroll Container Widget

`HorizontalScrollContainerWidget` renders widgets inside a horizontal scroll bar. The widget widths are fixed.

![HorizontalScrollContainerWidget](Docs/horizontal_scroll.png?raw=true)

### Horizontal Container Widget

`HContainerWidget` renders widgets horizontally with different alignment options.

![HContainerWidget](Docs/hcontainer.png?raw=true)

### Embedding in a View

You can easily embed a widget in a `UIView` like this:
```swift
let maker = WidgetCreator()
let button = maker.getWidget(ButtonWidget.self) {
    $0.text.text = "Button"
}
button.embedIn(parentView)
```

![Embedding](Docs/embedded.png?raw=true)

## Making Custom Widgets

A lot of widgets primarily display images and text and are laid out in horizontal and vertical stacks. **SwiftWidgets** provide a number of **components** used to define and display texts and images in a standarized manner, as well as utility classes to layout the views.

Let's have a look at a widget that shows an actor with their profile picture, name and character name:

![Actor widget](Docs/actor.png?raw=true)

```swift
class ActorWidget: Widget, WidgetInstantiable {
    typealias Model = ActorWidgetModel
    
    let content = HViewContainer()
    let vertical = VViewContainer()
    let nameLabel = UILabel()
    let characterLabel = UILabel()
    let imageView = UIImageView()
    
    public let imageComp = ImageComponent()
    
    override func build() {
        vertical.views = [nameLabel, characterLabel] // 3
        vertical.verticalAlignment = .center
        content.views = [imageView, vertical] // 4
        content.verticalAlignment = .center
        
        addContentView(content) // 5
    }
    
    override func load() {
        super.load()
        
        content.spacing = Settings.Offset.basic
        vertical.spacing = Settings.Offset.basic
        
        content.layoutContent() // 6
        vertical.layoutContent()
        
        imageView.snp.makeConstraints {
            $0.size.equalTo(60) // 7
        }
        
        LabelComponent().setup(target: nameLabel, model: model.name, widgetModel: model) // 8
        LabelComponent().setup(target: characterLabel, model: model.character, widgetModel: model)
        imageComp.setup(target: imageView, model: model.image, widgetModel: model)
    }
}

class ActorWidgetModel: WidgetModel {
    public var name = LabelComponentModel() // 1
    public var character = LabelComponentModel()
    public var image = ImageComponentModel() // 2
    
    override func afterInit() {
        image.setup = { image in
            image.layer.cornerRadius = 30
            image.clipsToBounds = true
        }
    }
}
```

1. `LabelComponentModel` customizes the text/htmlText/attributedText, font, color, alignment and numberOfLines of a label
2. `ImageComponentModel` customizes the image/imageUrl, contentMode, placeholder image, error image, activityIndicator, and tintColor of an image view
3. Set up a vertical container containing the actor name and character labels centered vertically
4. Set up a horizontal container containing the actor profile image view and the vertical container from the previous step
5. Set the horizontal container as the widget's content view
6. Layout the subviews inside the vertical and horizontal container
7. During the previous steps the constraints on subviews were overwritten, so we need to set the image view's dimensions
8. Set up the labels and image view components from model data

Then you just add the widget and set it up. You can easily make variants of the widget by specifying a different font, color etc.:

```swift
protocol WidgetMaker: WidgetContainer {   
}

extension WidgetMaker {
    func addActor(_ actor: MovieCastViewModel) {
        addWidget(ActorWidget.self) {
            $0.image.imageUrl = URL(string: imageUrl)
            $0.image.contentMode = .scaleAspectFill
        
            $0.name.text = actor.name
            $0.name.font = Settings.Font.with(size: 18, weight: .semibold)
            $0.character.text = actor.character
            $0.character.font = Settings.Font.with(size: 14)
            $0.character.color = Settings.Color.darkGray
            $0.padding.vertical = Settings.Offset.basic2
            $0.padding.horizontal = Settings.Offset.basic2
            
            $0.accessory.type = .disclosureIndicator
            $0.separator.enabled = true
        }
    }
}
```
